Description: The GECO metric investigates co-expressed sets of genes and their
    distribution within clusters to determine the biological quality of
    clusters. Using our scoring methods, each gene is given a predictive value
    between 0.0 and 1.0. These scores are then used to generate ROC curves, and
    the resultant AUC values represent the quality of the clusters. This process
    is performed iteratively over a given range of kmeans clusters and then
    produces a plot to help the user determine an optimal number of clusters to
    choose for their analysis based on the resultant quality of the clusters.
